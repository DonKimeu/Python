"""
Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values

>>>>>>>>>>Operator groups in Python<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
Arithmetic Operators
> Used with numerical values to performs common mathematical operations

Assignment Operators
> Are used to assign values to variables

Comparison Operators
> These operators are used to compare values

Logical Operators
> They are used to combine conditional statements

Identity Operators
> Used to compare objects , not if they are equall but if they are actually the same object with the same memory allocation

Membership Operators
> They are used to test if a sequence is present in an objects

Bitwise Operators
> They are used to compare binary numbers

# >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Arithmetic Operators <<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

a = 20
b = 30
''' (+) Addition operator used to add numerical values '''
print(a+b)      # Output : 50

''' (-) Subtraction operator used to Subract numerical values '''
print(b-a)      # Output : 10

''' (*) Multiplication operator used to Multiply numerical values '''
print(a*b)      # Output : 600

''' (/) Division operator used to divide numerical values '''
print(b/a)      # Output : 1.5

''' (%) Modulus operator used to get the remainder after dividing numerical values '''
print(b%a)      # Output : 10

''' (**) Exponentiation operator used to return the value of raising the first operand to the power of the second operand '''
print(a**b)      # Output : 1073741824000000000000000000000000000000

''' (//) Floor division operator used to return the floor value of both integer and floating point values '''
print(b//a)      # Output : 1
